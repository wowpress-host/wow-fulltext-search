Fast fulltext search provided by Search Engine software replacing default WordPress functionality.

== Description ==

Default WordPress search result pages are often slow and results they show are often not relevant. This plugin use specially designed Search Engine software for that purpose, which gives you both speed and relevance.

Useful when:

* You need your search results to be fast
* better accuracy for search results required
* natural language constructs has to be understood (search for "galaxy" has to return pages containing "galaxies" word)
* drop-in replacement of existing search result pages - no adjustments in theme code required

At [WowPress.host](https://wowpress.host/) company we often face situation when search results pages at websites we manage are extremely slow, or search results you get are not relevant. Search pages traffic may even affect whole website stability by taking all SQL server resources.
That happens because WordPress use SQL queries to perform the search but MySQL is not designed for that. There is only one working solution to prevent search slowness - use specially designed Search Engine server software written exactly for that purpose, and this plugin allows you to do that.
This plugin supports ElasticSearch engine to perform search requests, and our service available in every hosting environment.
Keep in mind that some technical knowledge required to set up and maintain ElasticSearch server software, also it's not possible to install it on every hosting environment so we do offer our Managed service available for everyone.

While we offer our search solutions to our customers for awhile with a lot of success, we decided to publish some basic solution to the community for free since we use a lot of open-source tools in our work too. Hope it will help you.
